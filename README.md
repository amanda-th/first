first project using css and html.

studied both in one weekend. this saturday i studied html, then sunday was css. monday i thought; why don't i make a simple landing page?

here it is! 

i spent about 10 hours doing this. the design is simple, but it's supposed to combine with aespa's aesthetic. clean and modern and using strong contrast.

i really enjoyed the result, i think i showed my personality in this design! everything i did was purely intentional, i know i could do more modern things, with round borders and such, but i'd rather go for this pointy and kind of agressive borders.

really proud of myself for a first project!

this landing page was inspired by the criativity of carrd's users. it is a popular software where you can make your own website with intuitive elements. search for "carrd inspo" on pinterest, you'll understand!
